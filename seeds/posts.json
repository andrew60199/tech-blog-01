        "content": "Whether you're building a full-stack application or an application composed of multiple frontend and backend projects, you'll probably need to share parts across projects to varying extents. \n It could be types, utilities, validation schemas, components, design systems, development tools, or configurations. Monorepos help devs manage all these parts in one repository. \n In this article, we will provide an overview of what monorepos are and what the benefits are of using Turborepo. We'll then build a simple full-stack application using Turborepo with React and Node.js using pnpm workspaces and demonstrate how the process can be improved by using Turborepo.",
